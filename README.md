The work plays with the underlying chaos of simplicity. By setting specific parameters and allowing for controlled randomness, a structured system embraces simplicity through formsâ€”lines that dynamically interplay between vertical and horizontal to reveal patterns and chaotic flows. The nuanced chaos lies in its simplicity and reductive nature, where generative shapes reveal sophisticated complexity and controlled chaos within a constrained framework. At first glance, the viewer might perceive the work as merely a collection of simple, repetitive shapes. However, as these shapes interface with one another, intricate patterns emerge, illustrating how simplicity can give rise to intricate outcomes. Through the use of basic geometric forms and algorithmic processes, the work creates a delicate balance between order and disorder. The resulting artwork becomes a reflection of this balance, demonstrating how controlled randomness within a minimalist structure can produce profound and intricate results. An idea borrowed from the fractal artworks of Kerry Mitchell, where simple rules generate complex, self-similar patterns, inspires this approach. By adopting Mitchell's concept, the work captures the essence of fractal geometry, showing how fundamental principles can lead to endlessly captivating and intricate designs.
