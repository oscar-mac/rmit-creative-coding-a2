 The work plays with the underlying chaos of simplicity. By setting specific parameters and allowing for controlled
 randomness, a structured system embraces simplicity through formsâ€”lines that dynamically interplay between vertical
 and horizontal to reveal patterns and chaotic flows. The nuanced chaos lies in its simplicity and reductive nature,
 where generative shapes reveal sophisticated complexity and controlled chaos within a constrained framework. At first
 glance, the viewer might perceive the work as merely a collection of simple, repetitive shapes. However, as these
 shapes interface with one another, intricate patterns emerge, illustrating how simplicity can give rise to intricate
 outcomes. Through the use of basic geometric forms and algorithmic processes, the work creates a delicate balance
 between order and disorder. The resulting artwork becomes a reflection of this balance, demonstrating how controlled
 randomness within a minimalist structure can produce profound and intricate results. An idea borrowed from the fractal
 artworks of Kerry Mitchell, where simple rules generate complex, self-similar patterns, inspires this approach. By adopting
 Mitchell's concept, the work captures the essence of fractal geometry, showing how fundamental principles can lead to endlessly
 captivating and intricate designs.
